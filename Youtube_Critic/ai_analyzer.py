    prompt = f"""
Act as an insightful YouTube Content Strategist & Critic. Your mission is to evaluate the channel '{channel_name}' by analyzing the textual blueprint provided â€“ the combined transcripts of several videos. You must distill the essence of the channel's communication style and effectiveness *solely* from this text.

**Evaluation Criteria:**

Carefully assess the transcripts based on the following criteria. Use *only* the specified rating scale: **Poor, Fair, Good, Excellent**.

1.  **Clarity & Conciseness:**
    *   **Focus:** How effectively is information conveyed? Is the language precise? Are complex topics broken down logically? Is there minimal rambling or unnecessary jargon?
    *   **Ratings:**
        *   `Poor`: Confusing, overly verbose, hard to follow.
        *   `Fair`: Generally understandable but often unclear or wordy.
        *   `Good`: Clear explanations, mostly concise, logical flow.
        *   `Excellent`: Exceptionally clear, succinct, breaks down complexity masterfully.

2.  **Engagement & Flow:**
    *   **Focus:** Does the text read in an interesting way? Does it use rhetorical questions, varied sentence structure, or storytelling elements (even small ones) to maintain interest? Are transitions between ideas smooth?
    *   **Ratings:**
        *   `Poor`: Monotonous, dry, abrupt transitions, lacks engaging elements.
        *   `Fair`: Some attempts at engagement but often falls flat; flow is inconsistent.
        *   `Good`: Generally engaging, reads well, mostly smooth transitions.
        *   `Excellent`: Captivating text, natural rhythm, uses engaging techniques effectively, seamless flow.

3.  **Authenticity & Personality:**
    *   **Focus:** Does the text sound like a genuine human voice with a distinct style, or does it feel generic, overly scripted, or potentially AI-generated? Is passion or unique perspective evident?
    *   **Ratings:**
        *   `Poor`: Sounds robotic, generic, lacks any discernible personality. Strong AI-generation suspicion.
        *   `Fair`: Reads like a standard script; little unique voice or personality.
        *   `Good`: Sounds like a real person; some unique style or passion comes through.
        *   `Excellent`: Distinct, authentic voice shines through; feels genuine and relatable.

4.  **Structure & Coherence:**
    *   **Focus:** How well-organized is the information within the transcripts provided? Is there a clear logical progression of ideas? Can you identify patterns like introductions, supporting points, and conclusions (even if informal)?
    *   **Ratings:**
        *   `Poor`: Disorganized, jumps between topics illogically, hard to see structure.
        *   `Fair`: Some structure is present but often inconsistent or unclear.
        *   `Good`: Mostly well-structured, logical progression is apparent.
        *   `Excellent`: Clearly and logically structured, easy to follow the argument or explanation.
